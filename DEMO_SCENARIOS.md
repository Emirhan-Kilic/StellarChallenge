## ðŸ“ˆ Pricing Psychology

### Why These Prices Make Sense

**Position Value = Time Saved Ã— Urgency Ã— Scarcity**

1. **Time Saved**: Earlier positions save more time
2. **Urgency**: Late for meeting = willing to pay more
3. **Scarcity**: Limited capacity = higher prices

### Real-World Comparisons

| Scenario | Time Saved | Comparable Service | Price Range |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Coffee Shop | 15 min | Premium coffee | 2-10 XLM |
| Theme Park | 2 hours | FastPass/Express | 50-200 XLM |
| Concert | Entry guarantee | VIP ticket upgrade | 100-500 XLM |
| Black Friday | Guaranteed item | Resale markup | 200-1000 XLM |

### Market Dynamics

**Morning Coffee (8 AM)**: High demand â†’ Higher prices  
**Afternoon Coffee (3 PM)**: Low demand â†’ Lower prices  
**Last Minute**: Urgent buyers â†’ Sellers increase price  
**Slow Day**: Sellers compete â†’ Prices drop

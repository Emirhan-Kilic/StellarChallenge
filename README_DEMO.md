## 📊 Price Psychology Explained

### Why Position #1 = 10 XLM?

**Time Value**:
- 15 min wait per person = 150 min saved
- 150 min = 2.5 hours
- Your hourly rate × 2.5 = value

**Urgency Premium**:
- Late for meeting = willing to pay 2-3x
- Flexible schedule = pay base price
- Emergency = pay any price

**Market Dynamics**:
- Morning rush = high demand = high price
- Afternoon = low demand = low price
- Limited capacity = scarcity = premium

### Price Gradient Logic

| Position | Wait Time | Time Saved | Value (XLM) |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| #1 | 15 min | 135 min | 10.0 |
| #2 | 30 min | 120 min | 8.0 |
| #4 | 60 min | 90 min | 6.0 |
| #7 | 105 min | 45 min | 3.5 |
| #9 | 135 min | 15 min | 2.0 |

## 🎪 Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: High-Value Queue
**Theme Park Ride**: 2-hour wait, 50 people
```bash
# Adjust prices for demo
Position #1: 200 XLM (save 2 hours!)
Position #10: 100 XLM (save 1.5 hours)
Position #25: 50 XLM (save 1 hour)
```

### Scenario B: Urgent Queue
**Concert Entry**: Doors close in 10 min, 100 people
```bash
# Scarcity pricing
Position #1-20: 500 XLM (guaranteed entry)
Position #80-100: 50 XLM (risky but cheap)
```

### Scenario C: Micro-Transaction Queue
**Food Truck**: 20 min lunch break
```bash
# Small amounts
Position #1: 5 XLM
Position #5: 2 XLM
Position #10: 1 XLM
```
